## Structural Models in Accounting Research
I am working on replications of accounting research that uses structural estimation especially in the field of disclosure,. The purpose of this project is

- to gain an understanding of the models,
- to show how to write codes in `R`.


Each project has two steps:

1. Simulate the data according to the model.
2. Estimate the structural parameters using the simulated data.

By simulating the model, we know the correct parameters, so we can see if the estimation works well. I do not use real data used in original papers because I don't have access to these data and I cannot share the data even if I have the data. However, once the estimation code that works for the simulated data is written up, we can just replace the simulated data with the real data.

- Description: This paper focuses on the incentive to beat an earnings benchmark. The feature of this paper is that they discretize the problem so that manager chooses on which bins their reported earnings is.
